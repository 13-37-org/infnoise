Thanks to Cor van Wandelen for writing these two programs, colormap.py and scatterplot.py.
He used these to create these png files from his inifinite noise TRNG.

To recreate similar plots, you can use data in the samples directory, and these commands:

$ cp ../samples/infnoise_raw.bin infnoise.bin
$ python colormap.py
$ python scatterplot.py

I created the raw data files with:

$ sudo ../software/infnoise --debug --raw > infnoise_raw.bin
