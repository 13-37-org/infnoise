Entropy = 7.999999 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 250000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 250000000 samples is 236.88, and randomly
would exceed this value 78.60 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4959 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141648914 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000055 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
