Entropy = 7.301405 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 25000000 byte file by 8 percent.

Chi square distribution for 25000000 samples is 17622621.04, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 129.3205 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.384906782 (error 7.74 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.002320 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
