Entropy = 7.999999 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 250000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 250000000 samples is 260.81, and randomly
would exceed this value 38.79 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5016 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141634994 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000053 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
