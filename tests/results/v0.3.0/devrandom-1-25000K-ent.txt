Entropy = 7.999992 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 25000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 25000000 samples is 264.53, and randomly
would exceed this value 32.77 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5009 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141490103 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000042 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
