Entropy = 7.999991 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 25000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 25000000 samples is 297.32, and randomly
would exceed this value 3.53 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4874 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142398263 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000066 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
