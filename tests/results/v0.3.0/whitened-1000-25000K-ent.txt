Entropy = 7.999992 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 25000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 25000000 samples is 261.66, and randomly
would exceed this value 37.38 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5000 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142448183 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000095 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
