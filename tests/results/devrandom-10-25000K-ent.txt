Entropy = 7.999994 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 25000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 25000000 samples is 216.16, and randomly
would exceed this value 96.29 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5120 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141322103 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000174 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
