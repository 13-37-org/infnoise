Entropy = 7.999993 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 25000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 25000000 samples is 259.65, and randomly
would exceed this value 40.74 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5080 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142139063 (error 0.02 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000241 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
